# Sandbox

??? note "Hello Tanks"
    - If you can expand this, details is working.
{ .role-tank }

??? note "Hello Healers"
    - This color + collapse proves attr_list is working too.
{ .role-healer }

??? note "Hello DPS"
    - This is the one that failed before with inline class.
{ .role-dps }

??? note "Hello Everyone"
    - Should collapse and be purple.
{ .role-every }
