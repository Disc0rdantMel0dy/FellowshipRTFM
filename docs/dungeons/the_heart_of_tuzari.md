You need to move the boss out of the way of the balls. Note: These will bounce around until they are soaked so you need to constantly be on the lookout for them.

        - You can clear your debuff by stepping into the fire pool **AFTER** Sacrifical Pyre cast goes off (**Don't stand in initial hit as it lethal**).

        - Ranged interrupt rotation on second root.  They will channel Toxic Spores to hit entire group.  Mobile melee can interrupt too by running in, interrupting, and getting out before they get meleed twice.
