??? note "Tanks (click to expand)"
    - **Tundra Stalkers** - Casts Rapid Fire cone AOE at tank.  Point away from party and then move to avoid damage.
    - **Blades of Cithrel** - Casts Slicing Blades which does a whilwind AOE.  Kite these to minimize damage or CC to interrupt. 
    - **Eldrian Chronomancer** - Erosion of Time, a Magic DOT on 2 random party members.  Dispel one and heal through the other (Or mass dispel relic if available).

??? note "Healers (click to expand)"
    - **Blades of Cithrel** - Casts Magic DOT Debuff that reduces healing received.  This needs to be dispelled, especially on tank
    - **Greater Ice Elemental** - Casts Frozen Stomp which does moderate raidwide damage. Group heals here.   If you are ranged and stand at max range you can avoid this damage.
    - **Eldrian Chronomancer** - Casts Decrypify, tank targeted channel, this should be interrupted, CCed, or CDed
    - Add healer notes (e.g., heavy damage windows, dispels, or priority heals).

    - **Blades of Cithrel** - Casts Slicing Blades which does a whilwind AOE.  Stay behind these so the tank does not aim blender at you.
    - **Greater Ice Elemental** - Casts Frozen Stomp which does moderate raidwide damage.  If you are ranged and stand at max range you can avoid this damage.
    - **Eldrian Chronomancer** - Casts Decrypify, tank targeted channel, this should be interrupted, CCed, or CDed
        - Add DPS notes (e.g., interrupts, kill priorities, or cleave management).

??? note "Everyone (click to expand)"
    - **Deceitful Scholar (Adept)** - Casts Volatile Orb which targets furthest player.  This must be kited away from group (pulses for damage) as if it hits the target it causes huge unavoidable raid damage.
    - **Shardlings** - These cause raidwide stacking dot when killed.  Stagger deaths or kill at once with mass dispel (if available).
    - **Ice Golems** - These cause ice shards to spawn under all party members, watch your feet.  When they die they spawn 3 shardlings (see above) on death.
    - **Glacial Shards** - Spawns freezing / slow puddles under random party members. Watch your feet!
    - **Greater Ice Elemental**

??? note "Everyone (click to expand)"
    - **Icy Death** - Spawns 6, high damage, small AOE cirlces at everyone's feet.  These are done in a coninuous chains so you want to do a small circle step to minimize space.  DO NOT RUN STRAIGHT WITH THESE!
    - **Splintering Ice** - When targeted by this ability (6 pointed star beneath feet) **STAND STILL** so that rest of party can position not to be hit.  Wait for dispel and pop personal defensive.
